AutobahnPHP
===========

AutobahnPHP is a Client and Server Library that aims to be compatible with the [Autobahn project](http://autobahn.ws/) 
and [WAMP2](http://wamp.ws/).

Basically, we like the WAMP idea, but we wanted to be able to work with it in PHP.

The project is brand new (as of June 12, 2014), so there is a lot of it that is in flux.

Please feel free to ask us what is going on or make suggests or fork it and make a pull request.

We have not setup the project in packgist as of yet (we want it to be a little more stable).  If you are just
wanting to play around with it, then feel free to clone and and run some of the examples (after running composer install).
